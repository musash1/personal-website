Hello and welcome to my first blog post. Today I will just tell you what
you can look out for and what type of content will be posted.

This blog was made to list my projects and talk about stuff
that interests me. I will usually write something in Rust or Svelte,
but I will probably also start testing new technologies that interest me.
Not dev-related content will involve Philosophy, hobbies of mine and day
to day struggles.

This is it for now. I will try to post an update every week, but i can not
promise anything.

Thank you for checking this blog post out.

Have a wonderfull day.
